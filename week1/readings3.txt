The Software Generation Tool Chain
Compiler
- Reads sources modules, parses input language. Code usually produced by asembly rahter than machine. Some Ccompilers form virtual machine
Assembler
- lower-level. can write routines directly form assemlbly language
- user mode: modules can have performance iritcla string
- os: moduls in clude cpu initializaiton
- locally defined symbols may not be assinged to hard in-momory adresses
Linkage Editor
- reads set of object modules and places in virtual address space, notes unresolved external references. 
- searches libraries to find object moduels that satisfy those refereneces
- then finds arelocatable/external symobl and updatst to refelct address of deisred code
- resulting bits of the pgm ready to be loaded into memory and exectued
Program Loader
- part of OS, exaing info int he laod module, creates virtual address psace (vas), reads instructiona nd data into that space. 

Object Modules
- Do not put all oof the code that will be excuted inot a single file 
  - too cumbersome
  - making modules availabl for reuse
- code in object mode is ISA speific
- ELF (exec and linkable format):
  - header section describes sections
  - code and data sections with bytes
  - symbol tabl
  - relocatable entreis
Libraries
- packaging modules
- ar(1): creating, updating and examping libaries
