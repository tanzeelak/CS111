lab4b.c: Uses AIO functions of MRAA library to output readings from Grove
temperature and current times. The executable can be run with
options,--period, --log, --scale. --period specifies the wait time between
outputting recordings (default is 1 second). --log specifies whether output
will also be written to a logfile. --scale determines temperature in celcius
or farenheight (default is F). In parallel, the executable accepts commands OFF (shutdowns the program), STOP (causes program to stop generating reports but takes input), START (causes program to begin), SCALE=F/C (changes scale of program to farenheight or celsius), PERIOD=seconds (changes waittime). The program was implemented with polling. 

Makefile: Builds and tests application with the following targets: default,
check, clean, dist. 

README: Includes information about student, describes included files in
tar.gz, and cites sources.
