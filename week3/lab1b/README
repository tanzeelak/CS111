lab1b-client.c: The program opens a connection to the server using the --port option. The --log option contians a record of data. ^D and ^C are passed to the sever program, to whic it is connceted to by pipes. The --log option puts all the data written into a given file. The --encrypt option passes a key file that is encrypted by the client and sent to the server program. The client then received an encrypted file form the server that it decrypts.

lab1b-server.c: The program connects to the client using sockets. This program uses the clients' commands to send them to the shell which it creates with pipes. Much of lab1a was integrated into this part of the lab. The --encrypt option passes a key file that is used decrypt the encrypted file sent by the client to the server. The server sends back encrypted data from the server to the client.


Makefile: Includes name, email, and ID. The three commands are all (creates botht he client and server executables), client (creates only the client executable), server (creates only the server executable), clean (remove executable and other unnecessary files), dist (builds tar file).
