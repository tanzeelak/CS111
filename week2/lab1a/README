lab1a.c: Compiles to accept the command line argument --shell. Without --shell, this program acts as a character-at-a-time full duplex I/O. Terminal is to noncanical input mode using termios. <cr> and <lf> are mapped to <cr><lf> during the read. With --shell, the program uses pipes to pass input/output between the terminal and the shell. pollfd is used to alternate between input forom the keyboard and input from the shell, by creating two polls for reading from the keyboard and for reading from input. waitpid is used to catch the shell's exit status which is interpreted and printed at shutdown.

Makefile: Includes name, email, and ID. The three commands are all (compiles the program), clean (remove executable and other unnecessary files), dist (builds tar file).
